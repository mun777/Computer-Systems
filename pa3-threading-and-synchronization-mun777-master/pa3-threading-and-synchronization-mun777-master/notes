notes
Client:
- need to join() threads after making them

Data Transfers: 
- create p-threads to introduce datamsgs (w/ecg)
- create w FIFOs for workers to use
- create w-threads to consume and process datamsgs
    ->worker threads produce result of process datamsgs
-create n-threads to consume resuts and populate HG w/ updates

Histogram uses Mutex to avoid race cond

File Transfers:
-collect file size 
-create a thread to produce filmsgs
-create w-threads to cunsume and procecss filemsgs
    ->use fseek (w/SEEK_SET) to write to file (open node important)

BoundedBuffer:
-stl queue with objects vector<char>
-uses mutex and cond variable 
    -mutex is wrapped in unique lock
-push waits on size<cap, notify pop that data is availible (cond var)
-pop waits on size >0; notify push that slot avalible (cond var)
